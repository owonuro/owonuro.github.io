I have worked in printing press, publishing house, and schools. Currently a computer teacher. One of the major drive of my success in life is my ability to face challenges and profer workable solutions. In my few years experience as a teacher I have realised that not everybody is interested in how tech works but how can I use tech to solve my problem. If what you seek is solutions , idea , simple guidelines on how to get the best from technology without stress then you are in the right place. The goal of setting up this blog is to profer technical solutions in a simplified way.","tags":"pages","url":"/pages/about.html","loc":"/pages/about.html"},{"title":"Free Data on MTN and Airtel","text":"FREE DATA ON AIRTEL AND MTN I have come to realise that a lot of people are not taken the free and legal data available to them on Airtel and MTN networks in Nigeria serious. Some might see this as a very small data while others might claim its insignificant. What can this small data do? They say. The truth! This data cap is significant and can mean a lot especially when you echust your paid data and you are unable to get data either through online or by loading recharge cards. What exactly am I talking about? I am talking about the daily data given to subscribers of Airtel and MTN by Opera. It is true that this data can only be used on Opera browser on any android phones. But you can use this data to do anything on this browser like open Twitter, Facebook, Google search, watch short videos, and most especially, you can use it to download. Yes! I mean dowload files from internet. Currently, I get 50mb daily and this means a lot to me despite my high data consumption. Remember, It doesn't matter if you have data or not. You just need to use your opera browser on your phone to get this daily awoof.","tags":"articles","url":"/free_data.html","loc":"/free_data.html"},{"title":"Public Goods","text":"CONCEPT OF PUBLIC GOODS -MEANING AND IMPORTANCE PUBLIC GOODS In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others.[1] Gravelle and Rees: \"The defining characteristic of a public good is that consumption of it by one individual does not actually or potentially reduce the amount available to be consumed by another individual.\" In a non-economic sense, the term is often used to describe something that is useful for the public generally, such as education and infrastructure, although these are not \"public goods\" in the economic sense. This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree. Public goods include knowledge, official statistics, national security, common language(s), flood control systems, lighthouses, street lighting, etc. Public goods that are available everywhere are sometimes referred to as global public goods. PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC GOODS Many public goods may at times be subject to excessive use resulting in negative externalities affecting all users; for example air pollution and traffic congestion. Public goods problems are often closely related to the \"free-rider\" problem, in which people not paying for the good may continue to access it. Thus, the good may be under-produced, overused or degraded.[6] Public goods may also become subject to restrictions on access and may then be considered to be club goods or private goods; exclusion mechanisms include copyright, patents, congestion pricing, and pay television. A public good is a product that one individual can consume without reducing its availability to another individual, and from which no one is excluded. Economists refer to public goods as \"nonrivalrous\" and \"nonexcludable.\" National defense, sewer systems, public parks and other basic societal goods can all be considered public goods. A public good is an item consumed by society as a whole and not necessarily by an individual consumer. Public goods are financed by tax revenues. All public goods must be consumed without reducing the availability of the good to others, and cannot be withheld from people who do not directly pay for them. Law enforcement is also an example of a public good. While public goods are important for a functioning society, there is an issue that arises when these goods are provided, called the free-rider problem. This problem arises because a rational person will not contribute to the provision of a public good since he or she does not need to contribute to benefit. For example, if a person does not pay his taxes, he still benefits from the government's provision of national defense by free riding on the tax payments of his fellow citizens. Characteristics of Quasi-Public Goods Quasi-public goods are goods and services that have characteristics of being nonrivalrous and nonexcludable, but are not pure public goods. Roads are a good example of a quasi-public good. All infrastructure is built for the benefit of the public, but as more of the public uses the infrastructure, it creates traffic and congestion, lowering the value of the good. Characteristics of education as public good As shown in the theory of public goods, education can be defined as a public good if it meets two conditions, namely if both is characterized by non-rivalry in consumption and by non-exclusion from consumption. Speaking of non-rivalry, the consumption of a good by one person does not lead to reducing the amount or quality of the asset, being available to all persons without creating additional costs. On the one hand, the accumulation of knowledge by one student during university studies does not diminish the amount of knowledge available to other students. On the other hand, to some extent, education is a rival good in consumption due to the fact that consumption of this good may generate additional costs. The non-exclusion feature implies the impossibility of excluding an individual from the consumption of a good as long as the benefits associated with consumption can not be divided. However, in the case of education, particularly higher education, it appears the possibility of consumer's exclusion through price. Much of the capital resulting from scientific research can be accessed by anyone, but also in this case the access to the other party may be restricted by financial factors, or copyright protection or because of confidentiality clauses assumed through the research contracts financed by the private sector. Measured by the function of training a highly skilled workforce, higher education respects, to some extent, the feature of non-rivalry. Regarding exclusion, this has been practiced since ancient times in societies where slave children had no access to the education system or in societies that considered education as a luxury of the nobility financed from private resources, until now through the emergence of the congestion effect as well as through the nature of the access to this level of education. So, in terms of access, as opposed to compulsory education, even going to high school, where individual's access is equal, in higher education we can discuss about the equal access up to the point from which education providers can exclude a number of individuals who can not afford to pay a fee for the offered services. In these circumstances the good higher education complies only in part the non-exclusion feature in the meaning that it can only be provided to an additional consumer up to limit at which either the consumer benefit registers a reduction or the producers costs register an increase. Thus, the good education may not be included in the category of pure public goods, since it partially fulfills the two characteristics attributed to public goods by literature. Yet education may be included in the category of mixed goods, more precisely in the category of \"public goods with limited capacity\" (Kraan, 2005, p. 32). Conclusions In conclusion, education, especially higher education, meets limited aspects of pure public goods namely non-rivalry and non-exclusion of the good, in terms of functions performed by it: the spread of knowledge, training people, service for society and its responsibility. Given the fact that at the international level education has been declared a national priority by most states, treating the nature of good education requires detailed research of the methods and sources of funding for each type of education system. Also, simultaneously funding of higher education from private and public funds determines the possible classification of the good education in the category of public goods, mixed goods or in the category of merit goods.","tags":"articles","url":"/public-goods.html","loc":"/public-goods.html"},{"title":"Anger","text":"CONCEPT OF ANGER ANGER QUOTATIONS \"Anger is anger, holy or not\" – Adeboye \"Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.\" – Ambrose Bierce \"Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.\" – Mark Twain \"Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.\" - Albert Einstein \"For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind\" – Ralph Waldo Emerson When angry, count one to ten before you speak.
